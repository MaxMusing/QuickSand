# QuickSand
QuickSand is a crowdsourcing app that allows anyone from students to strangers to buy and sell food from each other.

We, the creators of QuickSand, are Software Engineering students entering our second year of study in September. While discussing our living situations with our friends, we came to the realization that most students are in one of two camps: either they have lots of experience when it comes to cooking, or absolutely none at all. We tried to find a way to leverage this disparity in cooking ability between students. We wanted to find a way for the more experienced to make extra money from their cooking, while allowing the less experienced to get a quick, cheap meal. Thus, the idea for QuickSand was born.

## Getting Started
QuickSand is a mobile web application that allows users to buy and sell food from each other. Upon signing up, you can browse all the local food listings, or post your own. Ordering a meal notifies the merchant that their listing has been purchased, and gives them your basic profile information. Within the Profile tab, you can set any dietary requirements you have, such as Vegan or Gluten-free food.

## It's a date!
Once you've confirmed a purchase, all you have to do is meet the merchant at the time/location you agreed upon. Be punctual, bring exact change, and chow down!

## Becoming a QuickSand Merchant
Under the 'Sell' tab, you can view your current listings, or add a new one if you haven't already. You aren't limited to any number of listings, so go crazy! Creating a new meal is simple; take a picture of your dish, set a price, and youâ€™re set.

## What's next for QuickSand
We have loads of ideas for features that could make QuickSand even better! Primarily, we want to incorporate a geolocation feature, that only shows the user food listings within a certain radius. As well, an in-app chat feature would vastly increase merchant-buyer communication, allowing for last minute location changes.
